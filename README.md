# Data Visualization Practice - README

This repository contains various data visualization projects using **R**, **Shiny**, **Python**, **Power BI**, and **Tableau**. Each folder is dedicated to one of these tools and includes scripts, files, and visualizations created as part of my data visualization practice.

## Folder Structure

The project files and visualizations are located under the following directory:
`C:\Users\flong\OneDrive\Desktop\GitHub\Data_Visualization`

The main subfolders are:

- `Power_BI_Practice/` - Contains Power BI (.pbix) files for interactive dashboards.
- `Python_Visualization_Practice/` - Contains Python scripts utilizing libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualizations.
- `R_Visualization_Practice/` - Contains R scripts and associated visualizations.
- `Shiny_Practice/` - Contains Shiny app projects for interactive visualizations.
- `Tableau_Practice/` - Contains Tableau workbook (.twb/.twbx) files for visualizations.

## Prerequisites

To run the source code and open the visualization files, make sure the appropriate software for each folder is installed:

- **R** - [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org) and optionally [RStudio](https://rstudio.com).
- **Shiny** - Install Shiny package in R using `install.packages("shiny")`.
- **Python** - Requires Python 3.x. Libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly may need to be installed using `pip install`.
- **Power BI** - [Download Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
- **Tableau** - [Download Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop).

## Data Files

The datasets used for the visualizations are included in each respective folder for easy access.

Make sure the data files are available in the appropriate directories when running the visualization scripts or opening project files.

Feel free to explore the visualizations and modify the source code as needed!
